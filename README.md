# PHP MVC Example
[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/joecochran/php-mvc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joecochran/php-mvc)

Example PHP MVC using PSR-4 autoloading and composer.

**NOT FOR PRODUCTION**



This is a simple test application to stretch my legs in OOD. Once complete,
I'll be using this primarily to test framework agnostic composer packages.

Requires:
- league/plates
- league/route

Roadmap:
- Add phpunit tests
- Set up asset pipeline with Gulp for image minification, css and js
  concatenation, etc

to run:
`php -S localhost:8000 -t public` from root directory.
